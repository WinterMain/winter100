    <div class="article-content"><p>I would like to step away from using console.log all the time and use the Chrome Developer Debug Tool more often.
I found this nice <a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/stopping-using-console-log-and-start-using-your-browsers-debugger-62bc893d93ff" rel="nofollow noreferrer">How to stop using console.log() and start using your browser’s debugger</a> about debugging in general (setting breakpoints, executing line by line etc.)</p>

<p>But when I tried to use this in real life – which means to use it in a vue (nuxt) application I am working on – I could not get it to work.</p>

<p>All my files are combined into more complex javascript files, which I cannot debug.</p>

<p>I then found this post:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49892107/debugging-vue-component-in-chrome">Debugging .vue component in Chrome</a>
Which I thought would shed light onto this matter, but unfortunately I don't know what to do.</p>

<p>I added this:</p>

<pre><code>configureWebpack: {<font></font>
  devtool: 'source-map'<font></font>
},<font></font>
</code></pre>

<p>To my nuxt.config.js</p>

<p>But I would not see any sourcemaps of all my .js files in the debugger.
It would be nice if I could find all the js files for each vue component, for each store file, and for other utility files I wrote.
I am not sure if this is even possible, but I guess there must be a way to find my Javascript code within the debugger tool to actually debug it.
Or am I wrong?</p></div>
