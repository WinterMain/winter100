    <div class="article-content"><p>I’m trying out webpack (<a href="http://webpack.github.io/">http://webpack.github.io/</a>) and it looks really nice, however I’m kind of stuck here.</p>

<p>Say that I’m using a CDN for a library, f.ex jQuery. Then in my code, I want the <code>require('jquery')</code> to automatically point to the global jquery instance, instead of trying to include it from my modules.</p>

<p>I’ve tried using plugins like the <code>IgnorePlugin</code>:</p>

<pre><code>new webpack.IgnorePlugin(new RegExp("^(jquery|react)$"))
</code></pre>

<p>This works for ignoring the library, but it still says that the required module is "missing" when I run the webpacker.</p>

<p>Somehow I need to tell webpack that <code>jquery</code> should be picked up from the global context instead. Seems like a common use case, so I’m kind of surprised that the docs doesn’t target this specifically.</p></div>
